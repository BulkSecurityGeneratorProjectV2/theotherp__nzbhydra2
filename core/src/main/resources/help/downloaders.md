Hydra allows sending NZB search results directly to downloaders (NZBGet, sabnzbd). Torrent downloaders are not supported.

You can define a directory where torrents can be saved by clicking a search results. Configure your torrent software to automatically download those. 

### Downloaders

"NZB access type" is the same one as in the searching tab, only that it affects the downloads from the indexer.

You can select if you want to upload the NZB to the downloader or send a Hydra link. The downloader will do the download itself. This is a matter of taste, 
but adding a link and redirecting the downloader is the fastest way.
 
If you have multiple downloaders of the same type you can select an icon from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/). This icon will be 
shown in the search results and the NZB download history instead of the default downloader icon.
